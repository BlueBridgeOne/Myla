Alternatively, you can use the contact details at the end of this policy or update your contact preferences in your online account with us.</p>
      <p>As part of our service to you, we may contact you by email or telephone to provide essential information related to your purchases.</p>

      <p>You have the right to object to any of this processing at any time. If you wish to do this, please use the contact details at the end of this policy.</p>
      <h3>5. Disclosure of your details to third parties</h3>
      <p>There are certain circumstances under which we may disclose your personal information to third parties. These are as follows:</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">• To our service providers who process data on our behalf and on our instructions – for example our merchanting services providers. We require all third parties to respect the privacy of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Where we are under a duty to disclose your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies.<br>
      We do not sell to or share personal details with third parties for any purpose.</p>
      <h3>6. Security of your personal information</h3>
      <h4>Your debit and credit card information</h4>
      <p>If you use your credit or debit card to purchase products from us, we will ensure that this is carried out securely and in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). You can find more information about this by clicking here.</p>
      <p>(https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/).</p>
      <p>We may store your card details safely for use in future transactions. This is carried out in compliance with PCI-DSS and in a way where none of our staff members can see your full card number. We never store your 3 or 4-digit security code.</p>
      <h4>Security of your personal information</h4>
      <p>We have put in place appropriate safeguards (both in terms of our procedures and the technology we use) to keep your personal information as secure as possible. We will ensure that any third parties we use for processing your personal information do the same and that they will only process your personal information on our instructions. The third parties will also be subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
      <p>We will not transfer, process or store your data anywhere that is outside of the European Economic Area, unless we have a contractual agreement in place that is of an equivalent standard to GDPR.</p>
      <p>Myla staff are not allowed to put personal data on memory sticks or other such storage devices to protect against accidental loss.<br>
      Any Myla staff member who has access to personal data on their mobile phones must ensure that said phone is password protected and that in the event of loss, that data can be deleted remotely.</p>
      <p>All Myla laptops are encrypted so that personal data cannot be accessed by third parties in the event of theft or loss.</p>
      <p>Myla has a full “Leavers Policy” in place to ensure that once an employee leaves the company, they no longer have access to personal data via any means including electronic.</p>
      <h3>7. Data retention</h3>
      <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
      <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
      <h3>8. Your legal rights</h3>
      <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information, as follows:-</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) Request access to your personal information</p>
      <p>You have a right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. Please contact customer.services@myla.com to exercise this right, or any of the rights listed below. You will receive a response within five working days. If you are a European citizen and consider our use of your personal information to be unlawful, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK’s supervisory authority, i.e. the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) Request correction of your personal information</p>
      <p>You have the right to request that we correct the personal information we hold about you, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) Request erasure of your personal information</p>
      <p>You have the right to request that we delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Please note that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure if there are specific legal reasons- which will be notified to you at the time of your request.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">d) Object to processing of your personal information</p>
      <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">e) Request restriction of processing your personal information</p>
      <p>You have the right to request that we suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">f) Request transfer of your personal information</p>
      <p>You have the right to request that the personal information we hold about you is transferred to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">g) Right to withdraw consent</p>
      <p>In circumstances where we are relying on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
      <p>Please also note the following:-</p>
      <h4>No fee usually required</h4>
      <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
      <h4>What we may need from you</h4>
      <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
      <h4>Time limit to respond</h4>
      <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within five working days. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
