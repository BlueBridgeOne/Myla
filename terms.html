Furthermore, you will be required to provide payment details that you represent and warrant are both valid and correct and you confirm that you are the person referred to in the Billing information provided.</p>
<p>The Site is available only to individuals and others who meet the Myla terms of eligibility, who have been issued a valid credit/debit card by a bank acceptable to Myla, whose applications are acceptable to Myla and who have authorized Myla to process a charge or charges on their credit/debit card in the amount of the total purchase price for the merchandise which they purchase.

<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for further information about how we use your data.</p>
<h3>ORDERS</h3>
<p>All orders are subject to acceptance and availability and items in your shopping basket are not reserved and may be purchased by other customers.</p>
<p>Myla offers products for sale that are in stock and available for dispatch from our warehouse.</p>
<p>Myla will store a record of your transactions for a minimum of one year.</p>
<h3>PRICING POLICY</h3>
<p>Prices shown on the site in GBP/Euros are inclusive of all Duties and Taxes. For Deliveries outside of these regions additional customs charges may  be added depending on shipping location.</p>
<p>All prices and offers remain valid as advertised from time to time. The GBP/EURO/USD price of a product displayed on the Site at the time the order is accepted will be honoured, except in cases of patent error.</p>
<p>From time to time, prices are subject to change in response to currency exchange rate changes, markdowns and other commercial factors. The price applicable to your order will be the price current at the time your order is accepted.</p>
<p>If you are a customer whose credit/debit card is not denominated in GBP/EURO/USD, the final price will be calculated in accordance with the applicable exchange rate on the day your card issuer processes the transaction.</p>
<h3>ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR ORDER</h3>
<p>Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed, you will receive an email acknowledging the details of your order. This email is NOT an acceptance of your order, just a confirmation that we have received it.</p>
<p>Unless you cancel your order, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract between you and Myla will be completed when we email you to confirm the goods have been dispatched. The sale contract is therefore concluded in London, England and the language of the contract is English. Neither our third party payment processor nor our nominated courier has the authority to accept an order on behalf of Myla.</p>
<p>We reserve the right not to accept your order in the event, for example, that we are unable to obtain authorization for payment, that shipping restrictions apply to a particular item, that the item ordered is out of stock or does not satisfy our quality control standards and is withdrawn, or that you do not meet the eligibility criteria set out within the TOS.</p>
<p>We may also refuse to process and, therefore, accept a transaction for any reason or refuse service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of our withdrawing any merchandise from the Site whether or not that merchandise has been sold, removing, screening or editing any materials or content on the Site, refusing to process a transaction or unwinding or suspending any transaction after processing has begun.</p>
<p>Whilst every effort is made to make sure details on our website are accurate, we may from time to time discover an error in the pricing of products. If we discover an error in the pricing of a product in your order, we will let you know as soon as possible. We shall be under no obligation to accept or fulfil an order for a product that was advertised at an incorrect price and reserve the right to cancel such an order that has been accepted or is in transit. If you order a product that is priced incorrectly for any reason, we will email or telephone you to inform you that we have not accepted your order and/or that the relevant part of your order has been cancelled. If you have already paid for the goods, we shall refund the full amount as soon as we are able. In the event that products are recalled in transit, we will process your refund once the products have been returned to us.</p>
<h3>PAYMENT</h3>
<p>We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Maestro and any other methods which may be clearly advertised on the Site from time to time. You can also choose to pay with PayPal. When selecting this option at checkout, you will be directed to the PayPal site to 'Log In' and review the amount shown before clicking 'Pay Now'. Once this transaction is complete, you will then return to Myla.  Payment will be debited and cleared from your account upon dispatch of your order by Myla. You confirm that the credit/debit card that is being used is yours or that you have been specifically authorised by the owner of the credit/debit card to use it. All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorize payment to Myla, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery.</p>
<p>We take reasonable care to make our Site secure. All credit/debit card transactions on this site are processed using Adyen a secure online payment gateway that encrypts your card details in a secure host environment. If you are a registered Myla user, we will securely store your credit/debit card details on our systems. These details will be fully encrypted and only used to process card transactions which you have initiated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we take reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorized access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Site.</p>
<h3>GIFT CARDS</h3>
<p>Myla currently does not offer Gift Cards</p>
<h3>PROMOTION CODES</h3>
<p>Promotion codes are non-transferable and there is no cash alternative. Furthermore, they cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotion code or offers, and must be redeemed by the date published, if provided.</p>
<h3>INSURANCE AND DELIVERY</h3>
<p>You will own the goods on and from the later of the point in time when: (a) we receive payment in full, or (b) we deliver the goods to you.</p>
<p>Myla insures each purchase during the time it is in transit until it is delivered to your specified delivery address. We require a signature for any goods delivered, at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example as a gift) then you accept that evidence of a signature by them (or at that delivery address) is evidence of delivery and fulfilment by Myla, and transfer of responsibility in the same way. The goods are your responsibility from the time we deliver them to the address you gave us.</p>
<p>Please note that we aim to dispatch all orders within 24 hours, or 48 hours during sale periods. Delivery times appearing on the site are estimates and are to be used as a guide only and commence from the date of dispatch. In any event, we will deliver the goods to you within 30 days of the day on which we accept your order. Myla is not responsible for any delays caused by destination customs clearance processes.</p>
<p>If delivery is delayed by any event outside of our control, we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimize the effect of the delay. Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to cancel your order and we will give you a refund for any goods you have paid for but not received.</p>

<p>In the event that we have sent goods to you and you have cancelled your order, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent the goods back, whichever is the earliest. If we do not receive the goods back, we may arrange to have them collected from you at your cost.</p>
<p>You shall return cancelled orders to Myla Returns, Amethyst Group Limited, Lodge Road, Staplehurst,  Kent.

<p>You will have to bear the cost of returning the goods.</p>
<p>You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling, other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods.</p>
<p>Please note you may only use your right to cancel the order under the ICACRs if you give us formal written notice of cancellation any time after your order has been placed, up until 28 calendar days from the day after you receive your order, by email or post as described above.</p>
<h3>OUR POLICY</h3>
